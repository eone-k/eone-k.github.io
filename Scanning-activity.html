        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">Our goal with this activity is to perform a scan<br>here i chose the application pingplotter available on all Computer platform which will give us a more detailed look at what we are looking for, this includes what we are looking for including hops, time it takes to them, our network health, packet tracking and so on<br>Here is a picture of the application when you first start it out:<br>
        </p>
        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/image.png" alt="" data-image-width="1001" data-image-height="687">
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">On the top left corner of the screen we can either enter an IP address or a website to trace our route to it, usually for diagnosing network issues you want to trace to a stable server which has an expected outcome, so you have a base line to compare against, one of the better known DNS servers that is used often for it's low latency is the GOOGLE's 8.8.8.8 server, here we will put the IP of that DNS server in and click start:<br>
        </p>
        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-2" src="images/image1.png" alt="" data-image-width="991" data-image-height="736">
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4">After putting our desired IP (in this case 8.8.8.8) the program will start to trace the packet all the way from you LAN to the target, since we are using this app it also gives us the IP address of each server our packet travels through, so using that info we can tell that our LAN IP is 10.10.162.1, it's important to note that this IP is not our global IP and it's just a local IP for the main hub/router, further more we can see a graph at the bottom of the app that shows the roundtrip time in MS, using this we can also say that until the 2nd hop the internet is local, since we see an increase in latency after hop 2.<br>if we check hop 5 we can see that it goes from our city which is located In famagusta to another nereby city which is Lefkosa, this implies that the main link for Cyprus is at Lefkosha, after that we see another huge latency increase in hop 6, which as the name of the server suggests this is where internet from lefkosa goes to turkey, Adana to be exact!, now we know where cyprus gets its internet from!<br>in hop 7 we notice a huge Packetloss happening, there could be issues to the main lines due to the earthquakes, however now we know who is reponsible for those slow internet connections in cyprus, Leave broadmax alone guys!<br>In hops 9 to 11 we notice we have reached an internal server as the ip doesn't change drastically and if we look that IP up we will get:
        </p>
        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-3" src="images/image2.png" alt="" data-image-width="1037" data-image-height="582">
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5">As the IP look up helps us, we can see that we reached California and the IP is submitted under Google's name, therefore we made it to the desired DNS server.<br>
          <br>overall this was a very fun experiment to try and figure out what route your packet takes to arrive at the server you're requesting data from, we can see how easy it is to determine the causes of internet issues and also using this application (ping plotter) we can have some proof or evidence if the issue if from our ISP or not, if there ever was an issue that is!<br>
          <br>it is also important to note the more our app runs the more accurate results it will produce, here it is after 10 minutes of Running:
